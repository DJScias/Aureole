# Aureole Suite
###### A suite of tools for modding and datamining the early Trails/軌跡 games

## Park Block - Calmare
Calmare is a decompiler and recompiler for script files.
It can currently handle the scenario scripts for all games from Sky FC up through Azure.

In the future it is intended to also support animation/battle scripts, tables, and a number of other auxiliary files.

There is a short guide/tutorial [here](aureole.kyuuhachi.dev/guide).

## Residential Block - Cradle
A tool for converting itp and itc files to and from png/dds.

Currently it uses dds if there are mipmaps, png otherwise; might add an option to select manually later.

Support for Sky PC's .ch and ch/cp is planned for later.
