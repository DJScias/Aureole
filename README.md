# Aureole Suite
###### A suite of tools for modding and datamining the early Trails/軌跡 games

Currently the "suite" contains only one tool that is meaningful for end users.

## Park Block - Calmare
Calmare is a decompiler and recompiler for script files.
It can currently handle the scenario scripts for all games from Sky FC up through Azure.

In the future it is intended to also support animation/battle scripts, tables, and a number of other auxiliary files.

There is a short guide/tutorial [here](aureole.kyuuhachi.dev/guide).
