# Park Block - Calmare
> Built as the ultimate in rest and relaxation for the
> citizens of the Ark, the Calmare district is Liber Ark's
> premiere park and recreation district, located in the west
> of the city. Each section of the park, designed around the
> theme of 'harmony between progress and nature,' is a hexagon
> exactly 300 arge across. Calmare as a whole is made up of
> dozens of dozens of these hexagons.

> The Calmare District has four Halo Rail stations--
> North, South, East and West.
>
> Each station's tour path routes through different sections
> of Calmare, allowing one to enjoy vistas of all the seasons
> and wildlife Calmare has to offer.

Calmare is a decompiler and recompiler for script files.

In the future it is intended to also support animation/battle scripts, tables,
and a number of other auxiliary files.

## Usage

For basic usage, simply drag a script file (normally `._sn` or `.bin`) onto the
Calmare executable file. To recompile, drag the resulting `.clm` file onto it
again. For more advanced command-line usage, use `--help`. For a more
in-depth tutorial, see the [Bracer's Notebook](guide/index.md).
