# Residential Block - Cradle
> Located on the south side of Liber Ark, the Cradle district
> is the cozy, beloved home of the majority of the Ark's
> citizens. It is comprised of 128 blocks, each with its own
> Halo Rail station, public service buildings, city offices,
> and event halls, allowing citizens to enjoy everything the
> Ark has to offer--all close to home! As there are vacancies
> in a third of the blocks due to recent population changes,
> feel free to inquire about owning another home at the
> nearest city office.

Cradle is a converter for Falcom's image, sprite, and (planned) 3D model files
to and from more conventional formats.

## Usage

Since the Liberl and Crossbell series use completely different file formats[^evo],
Cradle <del>has</del> <ins>will have</ins> two different executable files,
`cradle-ed6` and `cradle-ed7`. For details on the various formats supported
(and some not (yet) supported), see the [Formats](./cradle-formats.md) page.

For basic usage, simply drag an image file file onto the Cradle executable file.

[^evo]: *Sky Evolution* uses the same formats as Crossbell.
