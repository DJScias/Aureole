Structure is largely the same as FC, but archive numbers are mostly increased by 0x20.
There is also a `mg05.{x3,hd,ct}`, which is the same as fields and battlefields.
	20:
		Same as fc, plus:
		- encback._ds
		- encount._x3
	21..=25, 28, 2B..=32, 34, 35, 39, 3C: unchanged
	(24's contents need double checking)
	(06, 26), (07, 27), (09, 29):
		Same as fc, but split up for whatever reason
	2A, 33:
		Uses .x3 instead of .x2, but otherwise same
	36:
		contains many more, but seems to be roughly the same
	38:
		Corresponds to fc.1B (probably 37 corresponds to fc.1A)
	3A: Minigame, fish, cooking textures
		- m{nn}_{mmmm}._ds
			- 00: roulette
			- 01: slots
			- 02: blackjack
			- 03: fishing
			- 04: poker
		- fishback._ds
		- fishsepa._ds (absent)
